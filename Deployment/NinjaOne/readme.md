# NinjaOne Integration - Overview

Some scripts in this repo branch have been depricated, with new instructions available directly from within the Cove documentation at the below link:

https://documentation.n-able.com/covedataprotection/USERGUIDE/documentation/Content/external-cove-integrations/ninjaOne/NinjaOne.htm

With use of this guide, you will be able to roll out Cove Data Protection (Cove) onto your NinjaOne devices with just a few clicks. After the roll-out, the backup software is not only installed but also configured with a backup Profile and Retention Policy of your choice.

## The automation policy will:

- Download the latest version of Cove's Backup Manager
- Save the download in C:\Users\Public\Downloads\
- Download and silent install the Backup Manager in a customer with a profile and retention policy
- Remove the downloaded installer after installation
  
  Note: There is no reboot required
